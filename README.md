# Better Link Clicker

An Obsidian plugin that modifies the default click behavior of bidirectional links.

Directly clicking on a link no longer redirects you, but instead edits the link (in live mode).

When a user clicks on a link that does not have a note below it, a confirmation window is displayed before a new note is created.

Both of the above features can be configured in the settings panel.
